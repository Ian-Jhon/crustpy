### crustpy

This code follows the thermal evolution of a neutron star crust.
An IPython notebook is included that shows how to run a model of the MXB 1659 lightcurve (see [Brown & Cumming 2009](http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/698/2/1020)). Alternatively, use `python crustcool.py` which plots the results in `crustcool.pdf`.
